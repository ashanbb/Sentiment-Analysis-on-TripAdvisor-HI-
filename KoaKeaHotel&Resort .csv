"We had a fabulous experience at the Koa Kea - terrific pool, hot tub, rooms and delicious menus at the restaurant and the pool bar. The staff were over the top considerate, friendly and accommodating."
The minute you walk into this place you relax. It has such a nice feel to the hotel and very clean and rooms are to a high standard. You have amenities close buy if you fancy a stroll out for dinner. I miss this place already!

"Koa Kea is a botique-type hotel and is currently the newest/most-recently renovated hotel on the island. This is the best place we've ever stayed. Ever. To me, it's all the little things that make Koa Kea head and shoulders above any other place we've stayed...More"
"Based on other Trip Advisor reviews, I convinced my travel agent to switch us to this resort rather then one of the big Poipu Hotels. I was looking for something with more of a resort feel but smaller and less hectic than the huge mega-resorts....More"
