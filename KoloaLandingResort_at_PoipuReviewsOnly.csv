"When planning our return trip to Kauai, husband and I were happy to read that all the renovations to the Koloa Landing Resort were completed. We then went ahead and booked a deluxe studio for mid-October. Upon our check in after a long flight and dark rainy drive from the airport, we were greeted warmly at the front desk. While we are platinum status, we weren't expecting a room upgrade, but much to our delight, was advised by the clerk that we received one. However, it wasn't until we got to our room, or should I say villa, how nice the upgrade was. It was a one bedroom, 1 1/2 bath, almost 1000 square feet corner villa with 2 full walls of windows in the lovely living room alone. The villa was beautiful. Our view of the smaller family pool and soccer field was so nice. Really enjoyed being in this area as it's quieter than the large main pool. This property is amazing - everything is well maintained and all of the staff that we interacted with were very nice. 

Tip - I noticed through the various reviews that those guests that weren't happy with this property, primarily were disappointed that it wasn't a full service luxury resort, with valet parking, multiple restaurants, 24 hour room service, nightly turn-down service, housekeeping daily (every 3rd day they do a full cleaning), but do provide towels and empty waste baskets daily. You can request daily full cleaning for an extra charge. Additionally, some reviewers are disappointed that it's not beachfront. The thing is, all of the Koala Landing Resort's information indicates what it is and isn't as well as all of the reviews on this site as well as others. That is how I knew I wanted to stay here - I wanted a more upscale villa/condo like setting. If I wanted some of the other amenities, there are other places to choose from."
"Stayed here February 2018. Our second visit to this property in two years. Was under construction during our first visit. The additions to the property were well worth waiting for. New pool is amazing but draws a lot children at one end. Spent one day at the upper end without kids, which was nice. Spent several days at the Tranquility Pool, which is my favorite and no kids allowed. Had a smaller villa this trip. Only one bedroom but more than big enough for our needs. The villas are beautifully decorated. Two bathrooms. Tub and vanity in one, the other toilet, vanity, and shower. Kitchen has everything you need to do as much cooking as you could want, including dishwaher. Also, had washer and dryer and two tv's. My only complaint was the blow dryer. Had next to no power. Glad I have short hair. The velvet like pouch with the resort logo embroidered on it had to be worth more than than the blow dryer.
The new Holoholo Bar and Grill is a wonderful addition. Our favorite bartender from two years ago was still there. Her name is Nicky. She can never do enough for you.
Be sure to look her up. You won't be sorry! The entire staff is pretty amazing. Will I stay here again? You bet I will."
"We looked at so many hotels before finally booking at Koloa Landing. They refer to it as a ""resort"" but it is hardly that at all. Upon arrival no one greeted us, no one bothered to help us with our bags, and no one to even valet our rental car if we were interested in doing so. One person worked the front desk while a line formed. The front desk staff is not welcoming and certainly did not make us feel the Hawaiian spirit that we have felt in so many other Hawaiian hotels. We made it to our room which was sub-par. Our view out of the sliding glass door was of the parking lot. The room was very dark. Again, not the Hawaiian vibe that you would like when spending this much on the room. We made our way out to the pool. Its nice but way off in the distance is the ocean. WAIT! This hotel doesn't even sit on the beach like all of the others? The website sure makes you feel like you are going to be! What a joke! The best part, after paying $495/night we see on the key card holder that housekeeping only ""cleans"" your room every third day! So, for $495/night my husband and I made our own bed each day. This has the look and feel of a Airbnb or Condo rental - not a ""resort"". I would say the best people this hotel would be for is a family with little kids. The rooms have a kitchenette that would allow you to have food on hand. 

We've stayed at the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton for the same price but with an abundance of ""resort"" amenities, friendly staff, and exceptional rooms in comparison. Never again will we fall for a beautiful website. Such a waste of money."
"We were in 401 building 11, fantastic views from all rooms. A little of the parking lot, but looking over that made it un-obstructed to the water. The only reason I did not give 5 stars, as that is what the villa rated, was the following: 1) large slide closed two of three days; 2) incident in the main pool had it closed one day; 3) coffee maker did not work and was replaced too late to use for breakfast first day; 4) the morning staff when we stopped by before check in, was very indifferent and did not acknowledge any status, gave the were too cool for you impression, as a lifetime gold with >500 stays I was not impressed with her either. The afternoon staff was great and welcomed us with a nice lei greeting.

The rest of the staff was great. We stored our luggage and groceries until our 4 PM arrival. The bar staff was wonderful, the room attendant was perfect (efficient and pleasant) and it was clear about the extra services. Unless you a total slob, you can keep your villa up for a couple of days between cleanings, they do come and get trash, gave you more towels and coffee. We do not have small children, and would come back in spite of them causing the pool to close for one day. Oh, finally great snorkel / diving spot just 100 yards down the beach and surfing lessons 1/2 mile the other direction!!!"
"This is a beautiful, recently upgraded property in a very good location. We appreciated the ease of walking to nice dinners, shopping, gorgeous sunsets and the kitchenette and laundry in our room. Everything feels brand new. 
Sadly our first and last impressions with the lobby staff were negative. They seem disinterested in their guests and give off an air of being bothered by guests when it comes to doing their jobs. At check in the woman asked for our children’s names to add them to the reservation. Having unique names they attempted to spell them for her. She sighed a heavy sigh and said it didn’t really matter how they were spelled. She never recognized platinum status or offered the welcome gift, upgrade, etc. Later my husband went back and asked about these things to be coldly told they could do the welcome gift but had no upgrades available - without even looking. However, the hotel was not even close to full and upon looking online there were plenty of larger rooms available all over the resort. 
Before checkout we requested a late checkout and that was declined. The staff in the lobby at checkout acted like they were glad to see us go. It’s not like we are rude or loud or had been a problem at any point in our stay so I have no idea why every person at the check in desk acted like we were bothering them. 
For this reason alone I doubt if we’d return to this hotel but would instead try another Marriott property on island. 
If you do choose to stay here and plan to use the pull out couch, make sure to request a pad for the mattress. That made a big difference for our kids."
