Review 
"This hotel is in desperate need of renovation and to upgrade its service. It used to be a tremendous property but it is not well maintained: hot tubs aren't hot, toilets run, elevators smell (overheard in elevator ""I won't miss the smell of this elevator""),...More"
The room was spacious. The staff was friendly and attentive. The grounds were gorgeous. I had a housekeeper (Sam) who brought my favorite flavor of cookie for turn-down every night- above and beyond! It was nice to not have to fight for pool chairs like I have at other resorts. There were plenty here. Every night there were local crafts for sale in the lobby and entertainment. I also liked the filtered water stations all over the hotel!
"What a disappointment. The only thing I liked about this hotel was the opulent and spacious lobby. There was nothing special about this hotel and the food was subpar at best. I sure wanted to take a hot bath in my room -- problem was there was no bathtub in my room, just a shower. Never again. Stay at a cheaper hotel on the north end of the island."
"We loved the Grand Hyatt! The pool and lazy river can’t be beat. The lawn and gardens are perfectly manicured, and Shipwreck beach is perhaps the most picturesque on the south side. Our partial ocean view room’s view was absolutely lovely. Poolside food and drinks can’t be beat, especially on a sunny day. We’ll be back."
"Very nice hotel and grounds but the rooms are just standard hotel rooms. For $500 a night you would thing the room would better than a Hampton Inn. Will not be going back there. They started some work on the room next to ours and were using a jackhammer, you would think they would make to guest were out. Morons!"
"Hyatt in Kauai the best hotel on this beautiful island. It's a high end hotel so expect it to be pricey, but worth every penny spent. The property is beautiful with an exceptional service. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and very clean. Enjoyed every minute of...More"

the Grand Hyatt in Kauai is a high end hotel with exceptional service. Pros + Service - I cannot say enough how wondering the service was. Everyone at every level was exceptional nice and accomodating + Room - we used points for this stay and...More
"We love visiting the Grand Hyatt. Highly recognized for its love of Wildlife (many water birds, a resort cat named, Grand and a Hen and her chicks enjoying the spacious scenery) the resort loves and cares for. The spacious landscape is unbelievably stunning - lush...More"
It's like they gave the landscape architects an unlimited budget. Every corner of this property is crammed with tropical plants and interesting visual features. The multi-level cascading pool is simply amazing and ending up at the self-contained salt water pool complete with a sandy beach....More

"This property is absolutely gorgeous. Its hard to nail down a single detail that made this place amazing but it was literally everything about the property. The only negative I can think of is the beach was red-flagged for dangerous surf during our stay, but...More"
"This was our third visit to the Grand Hyatt Kauai, and all three visits were outstanding. This trip started out on a bad note in that our flight was seriously delayed, so I called ahead and the front desk handles the cancellation without penalty. When...More"

"Great property with excellent dining, can’t wait to come again. We drove around most of the island and think Poipu is the place to be and the Hyatt is in a great spot. We are looking forward to coming back!"
This property on Kauai is beautiful - especially the outdoor areas - pool/beach/outdoor dining. Variety of pool options and not overly crowded (always found a variety of options even at the height of day).

Great facilities. Great poolside food. HORRID coffee and a ridiculously high daily activity fee make this hotel worth considering staying at a different location. A beach is right next to it but it is unsafe to get in the water.

Amazing facility. We spent 10 days here and I have no complaints. All the restaurants are excellent. All staff were attentive and focused on our satisfaction. My advice: it can be difficult to get into the restaurants so make reservations as soon as you arrive....More

Worth it to stay in such a beautiful location. My kids loved the zero entry salt water lagoon. Perfect for families of all sizes. Can't wait to get a chance to go back. My favorite location on the island
