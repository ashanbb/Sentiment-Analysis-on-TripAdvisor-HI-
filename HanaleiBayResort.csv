Review 
"Great experience, staff very helpful and prompt, the location is amazing, the view of the bay and mountains has got to be one of most beautiful in the world. Traffic on the Northside of Kauai is much less than South Kauai. Hanalei Resort is about...More"
"My wife and I think this is the most beautiful property we have ever seen. The views of Hanalei Bay, Bali Hai and the mountains are spectacular. Coffee and breakfast on the lanai with serene mountain and bay views were wonderful and relaxing. 

We shared a 2-bedroom unit with another couple, and the accommodations were clean and comfortable. 

The Ukulele Bar at the beautiful pool was a wonderful addition to HBR's amenities. We one dinner at the recently-opened Happy Talk Lounge, and hope that the Bali Hai Restaurant will open soon. 

Each and every HBR staff member was positive and friendly, with the ""Aloha Spirit"" embedded in all of their actions."
"This time-share resort is quiet with beautiful landscaping, ample tennis courts and very close to the golf course (neither of which we tried). This was during the ""down season"" and it was very rainy.
It is rather dated and could use some TLC. The chairs of the dining set and stools were pretty filthy. A good shampooing could have resolved that. Carpet was rippling badly and could use a stretching to avoid an accident. There was construction going on including jack hammering so maybe they are on it.
We had a 2 bedroom with lock off (#5101&2) and the room with 2 queens has no A/C nor windows to open so being on the ground floor was difficult---very hot. Both bathrooms had a vent but no fans (??)
Concierge gave us the wrong directions to a restaurant which took us way out of our way. When we checked in we were told there was a $20 fee per person, per day (ouch!) for parking---which is tight--WiFi usage and a pool towel. Really? We didn't use their WiFi and only 1 towel each. It was not a good way to start the trip---but learned later it was $20/day no matter the # of people in your room(s). 
There are limited amenities--the restaurant is not open due to construction. 
Try a cocktail at the St Regis (approx 1 mile away) for a sunset. The beach path takes you right to it's pool area or the lounge upstairs is spectacular.
Chickens are everywhere and very cute with chicks but can mess your patio quickly.
Didn't deserve a Silver rating on Interval Intl."
"Wow! This is a take your breath away resort. Great staff, great accommodations, great pool, lots of well maintained tennis courts, some of the best views in the world. Biggest issue is they are always full, it takes luck to get a reservation. There are lovely two and one bedroom apartments. So much better than a hotel room! This is one of the best choices of the islands!!"
"Although a third floor, ocean view condo is always our request, the mountain view units are stunning as well. The grounds are impeccable. The resort is older, but updated. The units are extraordinarily roomy. (Not found in newer resorts) You cannot find a more beautiful settling on the island! The staff is there to make sure you are well taken care of and you feel the 'Ohana the minute you check in. Most have been there for many, many years and there is a feeling of pride of ownership displayed by all from the front desk to the grounds keepers. Hanalei Bay Resort has spoiled us and has raised the bar for any other places we have traveled!"
"We stayed in room 2201/2202. It was updated, clean, and the bed was comfortable. The view from our room was fantastic. There's nothing better than sleeping with a Hawaiian breeze! I read other reviews about rude staff but we didn't experience this. Everyone at the...More"
