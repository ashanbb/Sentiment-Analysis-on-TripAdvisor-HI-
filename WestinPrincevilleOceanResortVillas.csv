Review 
"This property is a time share/hotel. We booked a week. We booked a suite - which had a separate bedroom and pullout couch and a spa bath. Average price $450-740 per night.
Quite a large property with 7 buildings - we were in Building 3. Lots of walking as you can't park near any of the buildings. It rains in Kauai in March - a lot - so make sure you have umbrellas. Great place for families with children - kids pools. No beach access on this property, but you can have access to the St Regis beach - about 10 minutes away. Restaurants on the property are convenient but expensive. Friendly staff, business center. It is located about 10 minutes (driving) from the main shopping area and restaurants in Hanalei so you really need a rental car to get around."
"We had great experience at the Westin Villas. The rooms and surrounding were very clean Airconditioning worked well, and rainshower was nice. Beds and pillows were comfortable Everyone was very friendly and helpful We didn’t have a car the first few days and the shuttle to St Regis for dinners and to the Avis rental was helpful when we needed to rent a car. Wi-Fi worked great in all areas"
"Westin Princeville is a nice property, and the grounds are lovely & well maintained, but it is not located on the beach, nor can you see the water from most of the rooms. The hotel sits high on a cliff. This is a time-share property & if I were an owner, I would not be happy with the lack of views from most of the rooms. We overlooked part golf course & part parking lot in bldg. 6.
Parking is not good. The small lot in b/w 3 bldgs. filled up & had to park & walk a distance away.

The weather was not the best, but during nicer weather, the pools & pool areas were packed. There are several pools, but areas are small. We finally got in the hot tub, & 6 young children ran over & got in....1 was spitting in the water. Hot tub time over. Need adults only pool.

Our room was very nice, but....We were in a villa and they all have connecting doors to the Villa next-door. We could hear people talking loudly and slamming dishes in the kitchen cabinets all hours of the day and night & the washer and dryer going all hours of the day and night. We also had loud elephants above our room stomping as well. I was a little surprised.

The employees were all helpful & very nice. Front desk staff were very polite & professional. The property offers a “tidy room” program where you can skip your room cleaning for the day for 1 free breakfast. I think this was brilliant & more hotels should this. It saves the hotel $$ & they pass that onto the customer. Very smart business. Breakfast was always a challenge as the birds were flocking into the dining area. We only ate breakfast 4x & all the food was awesome! Especially the loco moco. Highly recommend.

There’s not a lot to do @ the hotel since there’s no beach. They give you a pass to go to the St Regis beach 10 minutes away. 
The Westin has an odd vibe....or really lack thereof. If you like to hang out at the pool and not go anywhere, this is the place for you. 
It’s good for families with younger children. I personally could not imagine staying longer than 5 nights @ this property."
"Could not have been happier with our stay. Comfortable rooms, enough space for us all, friendly staff, great amenities, and very clean. The pool was amazing, the villa and grounds were pristine. Just an overall beautiful place. Can't wait to go back."
Our recent stay at the Westin Princeville Ocean Resort Villas was very pleasant. Our villa was lovely...clean and well appointed. The pools were nice and rarely crowded. Parking was not convenient because the closest lot was small and filled up fast. We usually had to park near the resort entrance and hike to our villa. The restaurants were very nice and all the staff were helpful.
"The Westin resort was great...the Fun Team made it AWESOME! A big ""thank you"" to Masa, Dereck and Jillian for playing many games of ping-pong with me. It helped pass the afternoons while my parents were lazy in the shade! - Bryce"
